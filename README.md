# Doubly-Linked-List-Implementation-in-C++
This repository contains an implementation of a doubly linked list data structure in C++. A doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, points to both the next and previous nodes, allowing for traversal in both directions.

Features
---

Insertion:
At the beginning of the list
At the end of the list
After a specified node
Before a specified node

Deletion:
From the beginning of the list
From the end of the list
Specific nodes by value

Search:
Find a node by value

Traversal:
Forward traversal
Reverse traversal

Usage
---
The implementation is encapsulated in a class doublyLinkedList with methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and displaying the list. It provides a comprehensive set of operations to manage the doubly linked list and can be easily integrated into other projects.
